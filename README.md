# World_Weather_Analysis
In this analysis, we had three different objectives to complete.
We were tasked to create a a dataframe using the OpenWeather API, which included weather data for different cities and the current weather description of citites.
We then we asked to create a customer travel destinations map, where customers can input their prefered temperatures for a vacation.
Lastly we were asked to submit a travel intinerary map, for a vacation in one country, visiting 4 different cities in that country.
